# Anywhere Web App

## Project Brief
**MVP - Minimum Viable Product** 
- A working full-stack, single-page application hosted online.
- Be a complete product, which means that it is usable from head-to-tail, in the environment it is meant for.
- Communicates with the Server
- Implement at least 10 API endpoints across all CRUD functions
- Use a database or a way to store your data
- Implement authentication. Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out with password hashing
- Implement authorisation by restricting CUD data functionality to authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.
- Require at least 2 types of login, example user and admin, the different types should have difference accesses to the APIs and Webpages

## Approach to Development
Using the plan and pseudocodes, I broke down the project into stages:
- [x] **Step 1:** Ideation Stage
- [x] **Step 2:** Create all the Controllers & Routes needed
- [x] **Step 3:** Create the Pages & Components
- [x] **Step 4:** Finalise web page flow
- [x] **Step 5:** Style Web Page

<br>

## Key Learnings
1. Important to categorise components and work on it

2. Prioritise which are essentials, which are add ons

3. Uploading Files requires a file hosting site to get the URL, then you can store inside your database

## Future Developments / Improvements
As this is created for a project submission, there might be no future iterations of this. However, if there were, these would be the future developments/improvements I would implement:

- Make the web more user-friendly
- Use Maps for Location Tagging
- Complete the Itinerary Portion
- Create DMs to communicate between users
