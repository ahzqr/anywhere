# Anywhere Web App

## Project Brief
**MVP - Minimum Viable Product** 
- A working full-stack, single-page application hosted online.
- Be a complete product, which means that it is usable from head-to-tail, in the environment it is meant for.
- Communicates with the Server
- Implement at least 10 API endpoints across all CRUD functions
- Use a database or a way to store your data
- Implement authentication. Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out with password hashing
- Implement authorisation by restricting CUD data functionality to authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.
- Require at least 2 types of login, example user and admin, the different types should have difference accesses to the APIs and Webpages


## Timeframe
2 weeks

<br>

## User Story
As a traveler and tourist, I want a one-stop travel app to source for travel inspirations and ideas and share my insights with the community.

<br>

## Key Features
1. Share Images of your Travel
2. Follow Users with similar interests
3. Save favourite itineraries
4. Search posts by destination country

<br>

## Deployment
The web app is deployed on Render: https://anywhere-cadu.onrender.com

## Approach to Development
Using the plan and pseudocodes, I broke down the project into stages:
- [x] **Step 1:** Ideation Stage
- [x] **Step 2:** Create all the Controllers & Routes needed
- [x] **Step 3:** Create the web page
- [x] **Step 4:** Finalise web page flow
- [ ] **Step 5:** Style Web Page

<br>

## Key Learnings
1. Important to study the APIs thoroughly to fetch the necessary information.

2. While overwhelmed, prioritising the critical components first is key to moving forward.

3. Create components to better organise your code to visualise it better.

## Breakdown & Analysis of the Codes
Below is a breakdown and analysis of some of the codes which I have categorised according to the concepts we have covered in class.

<!-- ### Routing
Routing to the necessary pages.

### UseState
To update the state of the information that we are seeking.

## Future Developments / Improvements
As this is created for a project submission, there might be no future iterations of this. However, if there were, these would be the future developments/improvements I would implement:

- Make the web more user-friendly
- Use Maps for Location Tagging
- Complete the itinerary
